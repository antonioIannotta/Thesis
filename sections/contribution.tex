\section{Introduction to the Fair-by-Design Workflow}
\label{section:workflow-introduction}

In recent years, heightened scrutiny of the ethical implications associated with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems has arisen in response to the escalating influence of these technologies, particularly in domains where consequential decisions profoundly impact individuals' lives. The evolving landscape of AI ethics necessitates a conscientious examination of the ethical dimensions embedded in the development and deployment of these systems.

Amid this multifaceted ethical discourse, the imperative of integrating fairness into the fabric of AI design has emerged as a paramount consideration. The principle of fairness, when applied as a foundational element in the design process, underscores the need for AI systems to produce outcomes that are not only accurate and efficient but also just and equitable. Achieving fairness in AI development demands a comprehensive and deliberate approach, one that transcends mere post hoc considerations by embedding fairness principles from the very inception of the design process.

The conceptual framework of a Fair-by-Design (FBD) workflow encapsulates a meticulous set of principles and procedural steps, each strategically devised to ensure the attainment of equitable and unbiased outcomes throughout the entire lifecycle of an AI system. This includes not only the initial design and development phases but also extends to the implementation, deployment, and ongoing monitoring stages. The iterative nature of this workflow acknowledges the dynamic interplay between ethical considerations and technological advancements, emphasizing the continuous reassessment and refinement of fairness strategies.

By adopting a Fair-by-Design approach, stakeholders in AI development, ranging from researchers and engineers to policymakers and end-users, commit to a shared responsibility for cultivating a technological landscape where the ethical imperatives of fairness and equity are not afterthoughts but integral components steering the trajectory of AI systems towards societal benefit and justice.

\end{enumerate}


\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth, height=.8\textwidth]{workflow-steps.png}
    \label{fig:steps}
    \caption{Fair-by-Design steps}
\end{figure}
    

\subsection{Objective Definition}
\label{subsection:objective}

The first critical step in the Fair-by-Design workflow involves a precise definition of the objectives, laying the groundwork for subsequent fairness considerations. This stage encompasses the identification of the goal of the study, the identification of protected attributes, the selection of fairness notions, and the choice of an appropriate fairness metric.

\subsubsection{Goal of the study}

The first target in the Fair-by-Design workflow is related to the identification of the goal of the whole study. It's fundamental to be able to understand whether the study requires a classification approach or a regression.


\subsubsection{Protected Attributes}

Protected attributes refer to the characteristics of individuals or groups that are explicitly considered to prevent discrimination and bias. The criteria for choosing specific protected attributes must be well-defined to ensure the relevance of fairness considerations. This may involve:

\begin{itemize}

    \item Conducting a comprehensive literature review to identify historically disadvantaged or underrepresented groups.
    
    \item Collaborating with domain experts, ethicists, and stakeholders to determine attributes with potential societal impact.
    
    \item Assessing the legal and ethical implications of including or excluding certain attributes within the specific context of the AI application.

\end{itemize}

The selected protected attributes form the basis for subsequent fairness evaluations and interventions.

\subsubsection{Fairness Notions}

Fairness notions represent the abstract principles guiding the desired equitable behavior within the AI system. The choice of fairness notions is a pivotal decision, influencing subsequent stages of the workflow. Common fairness notions, as explained in detail in \cref{section:fairness_notions}, include:

\begin{itemize}
  
    \item \textbf{Demographic Parity:} Ensuring equal representation of protected groups across different outcomes.
  
    \item \textbf{Equalized Odds:} Balancing the true positive and false positive rates across protected groups.
  
    \item \textbf{Individual Fairness:} Treating similar individuals similarly, regardless of their protected attributes.
   
    \item \textbf{Group Fairness:} Ensuring fair treatment for entire groups, typically based on statistical measures.

\end{itemize}

The selection of a fairness notion should align with the specific goals of the AI application, ethical considerations, and legal requirements.

\subsubsection{Fairness Metric}

A fairness metric quantifies the level of fairness achieved by the AI system with respect to the chosen fairness notion. The choice of a fairness metric depends on the specific fairness notion and the underlying characteristics of the data. Common fairness metrics include:

\begin{itemize}
   
    \item \textbf{Disparate Impact:} Measures the ratio of favorable outcomes between protected and unprotected groups.
   
    \item \textbf{Equalized Odds Difference:} Quantifies the disparity in error rates between protected groups.
   
    \item \textbf{Theil Index:} Evaluates the distribution of outcomes across different demographic groups.
   
    \item \textbf{Statistical Parity Difference:} Measures the difference in favorable outcomes between protected and unprotected groups.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Fairness Notions and Metric Alignment}
\label{subsub:alignment}

The alignment between fairness notions and fairness metrics is a critical aspect of the Fair-by-Design workflow, as it establishes a systematic and measurable framework for evaluating fairness. The following considerations guide the selection process:

\paragraph{Demographic Parity:}

For the fairness notion of Demographic Parity, the primary concern is ensuring equal representation of protected groups across different outcomes. This notion is often aligned with the fairness metric known as \textbf{Disparate Impact}, which quantifies the ratio of favorable outcomes between protected and unprotected groups. Specifically, the Disparate Impact metric is calculated as:

\[
\text{Disparate Impact} = \frac{\text{Favorable Outcome Rate for Protected Group}}{\text{Favorable Outcome Rate for Unprotected Group}}
\]

A Disparate Impact value close to 1 indicates a balanced representation, while values significantly deviating from 1 may suggest unfairness.

\paragraph{Equalized Odds:}

The Equalized Odds fairness notion aims to balance the true positive and false positive rates across protected groups. This aligns with the \textbf{Equalized Odds Difference} fairness metric, which quantifies the disparity in error rates between protected groups. The Equalized Odds Difference is computed as:

\[
\text{Equalized Odds Difference} = \text{True Positive Rate}_{\text{Protected}} - \text{True Positive Rate}_{\text{Unprotected}}
\]

A value of 0 indicates perfect balance, with positive or negative values signifying imbalances in the error rates.

\paragraph{Individual Fairness:}

Individual Fairness focuses on treating similar individuals similarly, regardless of their protected attributes. This notion is inherently challenging to quantify, but proxy metrics such as \textbf{Theil Index} may be employed. The Theil Index evaluates the distribution of outcomes across different demographic groups and is given by:

\[
\text{Theil Index} = \sum \left( \frac{X_{i}}{\mu} \ln \frac{X_{i}}{\mu} \right)
\]

where \(X_{i}\) represents the outcome distribution for a specific group, and \(\mu\) is the overall average outcome. A lower Theil Index indicates a more equitable distribution.

\paragraph{Group Fairness:}

Group Fairness ensures fair treatment for entire groups, typically based on statistical measures. The \textbf{Statistical Parity Difference} is a common metric aligned with this notion. It measures the difference in favorable outcomes between protected and unprotected groups and is computed as:

\[
\text{Statistical Parity Difference} = \text{Favorable Outcome Rate}_{\text{Prot}} - \text{Favorable Outcome Rate}_{\text{Unprot}}
\]

A value of 0 suggests parity, while positive or negative values indicate disparities.

These alighnments are well-represented in the following table


\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Fairness notion} & \textbf{Fairness metric} \\
    \hline
    Demographic Parity & Disparate Impact \\
    \hline
    Equalized Odds & Equalized Odds Difference \\
    \hline
    Individual Fairness & Theil Index \\
    \hline
    Group Fairness & Demographic Parity Difference \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Choosing Fairness Metrics Given Notions or Vice Versa}

Choosing a fairness metric given a fairness notion, or vice versa, requires a nuanced understanding of the specific fairness goals and the characteristics of the data. Here's a step-by-step guide:

\paragraph{Given a Fairness Notion:}

\begin{enumerate}
 
    \item \textbf{Define Fairness Goals:} Clearly articulate the fairness goals, considering the desired equitable outcomes for protected groups.
 
    \item \textbf{Identify Relevant Fairness Notion:} Select the fairness notion that aligns most closely with the defined fairness goals (e.g., Demographic Parity, Equalized Odds, Individual Fairness, or Group Fairness).
 
    \item \textbf{Choose Aligned Fairness Metric:} Based on the selected fairness notion, choose the fairness metric that provides a quantitative measure of the specified fairness goals (e.g., Disparate Impact, Equalized Odds Difference, Theil Index, or Statistical Parity Difference).

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Given a Fairness Metric:}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Understand Fairness Metric:} Gain a deep understanding of the chosen fairness metric, considering its strengths, limitations, and relevance to specific fairness goals.

    \item \textbf{Determine Fairness Notion Alignment:} Identify the fairness notion that aligns with the underlying principles of the chosen fairness metric (e.g., Disparate Impact aligns with Demographic Parity).
 
    \item \textbf{Ensure Consistency:} Confirm that the selected fairness metric is consistent with the broader fairness goals and ethical considerations of the AI application.

\end{enumerate}

This decisional process is well-represented in the following image:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth, height=1.3\textwidth]{notion-metric.png}
    \label{fig:choice}
    \caption{Fairness Notion and Metric choice}
\end{figure}

This meticulous alignment process ensures that the chosen fairness metrics quantitatively capture the intended fairness notions, providing a meaningful and interpretable basis for evaluating and comparing fairness across different models and interventions within the Fair-by-Design workflow.

In summary, the objective definition stage of the Fair-by-Design workflow involves a meticulous and well-informed selection of protected attributes, fairness notions, and fairness metrics. This precision ensures the subsequent stages of the workflow are grounded in a robust foundation for addressing bias and promoting fairness in AI systems.

\subsection{Data Collection}
\label{subsection:data_collection}

The data collection stage is fundamental for the Fair-by-Design workflow. It involves systematically gathering data to train machine learning models, coupled with a detailed study of the dataset's statistical properties, with a specific focus on protected attributes.

\subsubsection{Dataset Overview}

\paragraph{Data Representation:}

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Fairness-Aware Sampling Techniques:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If disparities exist in the representation of different groups, consider fairness-aware sampling.
    \item Aim to address imbalances during data pre-processing for equitable model training.
\end{itemize}

In summary, the data collection stage provides the necessary foundation for the Fair-by-Design workflow. It includes a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's statistical properties and guides informed data pre-processing decisions, crucial for developing fair and unbiased machine learning models.

\subsection{Data Pre-processing}
\label{subsection:data_pre_proc}

The data pre-processing stage is a critical component of the Fair-by-Design workflow, designed to transform the raw dataset obtained from the data collection stage into a format suitable for training machine learning models. This stage involves intricate processes, including converting categorical attributes into numerical representations and handling protected attributes with specific considerations.

\subsubsection{Categorical to Numerical Transformation}

Categorical attributes, often represented as strings, must be converted into numerical format to facilitate their integration into machine learning models.

\paragraph{One-Hot Encoding:}
One-hot encoding is a widely used method for categorical attributes without a natural order. It transforms a categorical attribute with \(K\) distinct categories into \(K\) binary columns, each indicating the presence or absence of a specific category. This approach prevents the model from assigning unintended ordinal relationships to the categories.

\paragraph{Ordinal Encoding:}
When there exists an ordinal relationship between categories, ordinal encoding is applied. In this method, each category is assigned a numerical value based on its order. This preserves the ordinal information while representing the categorical attribute in a numerical format.

\paragraph{Label Encoding:}
For binary categorical attributes, label encoding is employed. It assigns 0 and 1 to the respective categories, providing a straightforward numerical representation that aligns with the binary nature of the attribute.

\subsubsection{Protected Attribute Transformation}

Protected attributes, which play a pivotal role in ensuring fairness, require special treatment during the data pre-processing stage.

\paragraph{Discrete Protected Attributes:}
If a protected attribute is discrete (e.g., gender, ethnicity), it is left unchanged during the transformation process. This ensures that the inherent categories of the attribute are preserved, and the model can account for these categories without introducing bias.

\paragraph{Continuous Protected Attributes: Quantization Operation}
Continuous protected attributes, such as age, undergo a quantization process. Quantization is a method to discretize the continuous attribute into equal-width bins. This operation is represented mathematically as:

\[ Q(x) = \text{{floor}}\left(\frac{{x - \text{{min}}}}{{\text{{bin width}}}}\right) \]

where \( Q(x) \) denotes the quantized value of \( x \), \(\text{{min}}\) is the minimum value of the attribute, and the bin width is determined based on insights from the data collection stage. The goal is to create discrete bins that accurately represent the distribution of the continuous attribute within the population. This process ensures fairness by preserving the underlying characteristics of the attribute while converting it into a suitable format for machine learning models.

Quantization is particularly essential for continuous protected attributes to avoid introducing bias during the transformation. It aligns with the overarching goal of the Fair-by-Design workflow to maintain fairness throughout the machine learning model development.

In summary, the data pre-processing stage involves sophisticated transformations, ensuring that both categorical attributes are numerically represented and protected attributes are handled with precision. These steps are crucial for developing fair and accurate machine learning models within the Fair-by-Design framework.

\subsection{Algorithm design}
\label{subsection:algorithm}

he stage of Algorithm Design within the fair-by-design workflow stands as a pivotal phase wherein the selection, adaptation, or creation of machine learning models takes place to harmonize with the specified objectives and fairness considerations. The primary objective is to craft models that not only excel in accuracy but also steadfastly adhere to ethical and fair principles. This section undertakes an in-depth exploration of the crucial considerations, strategic approaches, and the step-by-step implementation processes entailed in Algorithm Design. By navigating through these aspects, the aim is to foster the development of models that not only deliver superior performance but also champion the ideals of ethics and fairness in their predictive outcomes.

\subsubsection{Key Considerations}

\begin{enumerate}

    The selection of machine learning models assumes a pivotal role in the pursuit of fairness objectives. Fairness-aware model selection entails the deliberate consideration of models equipped with inherent mechanisms to tackle biases and advocate for equitable outcomes. Noteworthy examples of such models include adversarial networks, fairness-aware classifiers, and re-weighted learning algorithms. These models are systematically explored and evaluated for their capacity to mitigate biases and foster fairness, thereby contributing to the overarching goal of cultivating just and impartial predictive systems.
    
    \item \emph{Regularization Techniques:} 
    
    In the pursuit of fair predictions, regularization methods, exemplified by demographic parity constraints or equalized odds constraints, emerge as instrumental tools. These methodologies are strategically employed to guide machine learning models towards fairness objectives. By integrating fairness constraints into the optimization process, these regularization techniques play a pivotal role in steering the model to yield equitable outcomes across various demographic groups. The inclusion of such constraints serves as a proactive measure to counteract biases and ensure that the predictive power of the model remains impartial and just across diverse demographic contexts.

    \item \emph{Bias Detection and Mitigation:} 
    
    The integration of embedding mechanisms within the algorithm to detect and mitigate biases is of paramount importance. This entails the ongoing and systematic monitoring of the model's predictions for any indications of disparate impact. Subsequently, corrective measures are implemented in real-time to mitigate biases as they manifest. This proactive approach to bias detection and mitigation serves as a fundamental component in ensuring the model's fairness and equity.

The choice between pre-processing, in-processing, or post-processing is heavily influenced by the fairness notion chosen. If the goal is to achieve demographic parity, pre-processing algorithms may involve adjusting the composition of the dataset to ensure proportional representation.

\paragraph{Evaluation Metrics:}
Metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-processing algorithms include statistical parity, disparate impact, or equal opportunity. The selection of the metric is contingent on the fairness goals and the specific aspects of fairness being prioritized.

\textbf{In-processing Algorithms}

In-processing algorithms intervene directly during the model training process, introducing fairness mechanisms at this crucial stage. This approach modifies the learning process to ensure fairness considerations are embedded in the model's development.

\paragraph{Relation to Fairness Goals:}
In-processing algorithms should be tailored to the specific fairness goals defined for the task. For instance, if the objective is to minimize disparate impact, in-processing techniques may involve adjusting the model's objective function to incorporate fairness constraints.

\paragraph{Dependency on Fairness Notion:}
The choice of in-processing algorithms depends on the fairness notion guiding the workflow. If the focus is on individual fairness, algorithms may be designed to treat similar individuals similarly during the learning process.

\paragraph{Evaluation Metrics:}
Metrics such as equalized odds, calibration, or predictive parity are often employed to assess the fairness of in-processing algorithms. The selection of the metric aligns with the fairness goals and the particular aspects of fairness under consideration.

\textbf{Post-processing Algorithms}

Post-processing algorithms come into play after model training, adjusting predictions to align with fairness objectives. This approach offers a corrective mechanism to fine-tune model outputs based on fairness considerations.

\paragraph{Relation to Fairness Goals:}
Post-processing algorithms should be chosen to complement the defined fairness goals. If the aim is to rectify disparate impact in predictions, post-processing techniques may involve re-calibrating predicted probabilities.

\paragraph{Dependency on Fairness Notion:}
The choice of post-processing algorithms is contingent on the fairness notion guiding the workflow. If the focus is on group fairness, post-processing methods may involve re-weighting predictions to achieve parity across protected attribute groups.

\paragraph{Evaluation Metrics:}
Common evaluation metrics for post-processing algorithms include reweighted accuracy, demographic parity, or predictive rate parity. The choice of the metric is aligned with the specific fairness goals and considerations.

\textbf{Strategic Decision Factors}

When making the strategic decision among pre-processing, in-processing, or post-processing algorithms, several factors come into play:

\paragraph{Nature of Biases:}
Understanding the nature of biases inherent in the data is crucial. Pre-processing algorithms may be more suitable for mitigating biases present in the raw dataset, while in-processing or post-processing algorithms may address biases emerging during model training or predictions.

\paragraph{Characteristics of the Dataset:}
The characteristics of the available dataset, such as its size, composition, and distribution of protected attributes, influence the choice of algorithmic approaches. Pre-processing may be favored for large-scale dataset adjustments, while in-processing or post-processing may be more suitable for fine-tuning models with specific biases.

\paragraph{Desired Level of Fairness:}
The desired level of fairness, whether it is absolute parity or a more nuanced balance, guides the strategic decision. Pre-processing, in-processing, or post-processing may be chosen based on the granularity required to achieve the defined fairness goals.

In essence, the choice among pre-processing, in-processing, or post-processing algorithms should be informed by a comprehensive understanding of the specific fairness challenges and objectives inherent to the machine learning task at hand. The alignment with the chosen fairness notion and the careful consideration of evaluation metrics ensure that the selected algorithmic approach is well-suited to achieve the desired fairness outcomes within the Fair-by-Design workflow.

\subsubsection{Detailed Implementation Steps}

% Include the detailed implementation steps for each key consideration as per the previous discussion.

\textbf{Fairness-Aware Model Selection}

\begin{itemize}

    \item \emph{Exploration of Fairness-Aware Models:}
     
    \begin{itemize}
    
        \item In the endeavor to develop a fair-by-design machine learning model, a pivotal step involves conducting an exhaustive survey and evaluation of existing fairness-aware models tailored to the specific application domain. This meticulous process requires a thorough examination of pertinent literature and available models, taking into account their performance metrics, interpretability, and fairness considerations. By subjecting existing models to rigorous evaluation, practitioners gain valuable insights into the nuanced strengths and limitations of different approaches. This discerning survey and evaluation process empower practitioners to make informed decisions regarding the most suitable model for their particular use case. Such diligence contributes significantly to the foundational aspects of a fair-by-design workflow, ensuring that the selected model not only aligns with technical requirements but also upholds ethical considerations inherent to the application domain.
    
        \item When delving into the realm of fairness-aware models tailored for a specific application domain, it is judicious to prioritize models explicitly designed to address bias. This consideration encompasses, but is not confined to, adversarial networks or models featuring inherent fairness constraints. Adversarial networks serve the purpose of mitigating bias by introducing a secondary network that identifies and counteracts any discriminatory patterns discerned in the primary model. Conversely, models with built-in fairness constraints integrate predefined fairness metrics into the optimization process, ensuring the model adheres to fairness criteria throughout training.

        The evaluation of these specialized models yields a nuanced understanding of their efficacy in handling bias, furnishing practitioners with invaluable insights into the most suitable approach for mitigating bias within their specific context. This deliberate consideration solidifies the fair-by-design approach, underscoring the paramount importance of selecting models that actively address and rectify biases to foster equitable outcomes in the realm of machine learning applications.    
    
    \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pre-processing Algorithm Proposed}

\paragraph{Fairness through data augmentation}
\label{subsec:ftdr}

IIn this approach, the paradigm of bias mitigation takes on a unique and innovative perspective, one that prioritizes data augmentation over attribute removal. Unlike traditional approaches that center on the exclusion of specific attributes, this methodology embraces the concept of data augmentation, introducing a distinctive definition of fairness and equity within the AI system.

The essence of this approach revolves around the augmentation of the dataset by introducing new data instances that offer a more comprehensive and inclusive representation of the underlying population. This expanded dataset is designed to be more diverse, representative, and balanced, transcending the limitations of the original data and fostering a more nuanced understanding of fairness. 

The introduction of augmented data instances leads to a redefined notion of fairness within the AI system. Instead of solely focusing on the absence of biased attributes, fairness is now measured in terms of the dataset's inclusivity and its ability to capture the diversity and nuances present within the population it seeks to serve. 

This approach aligns with the broader philosophy of ensuring that AI systems are equitable, just, and capable of making informed and unbiased decisions. By augmenting the dataset, it strives to bridge the gaps in representation and provide a more equitable playing field for all individuals, regardless of their background or characteristics. 

The process of data augmentation necessitates a careful selection of techniques and methodologies that can introduce new data instances while maintaining the integrity and quality of the dataset. These techniques may encompass oversampling, synthetic data generation, or other data synthesis methods, each tailored to the specific context and objectives of the AI system.

In traditional fairness definitions, the focus often revolves around ensuring fair treatment for individual protected attributes, denoted as $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_k$. While this is undoubtedly crucial, a more comprehensive understanding of fairness calls for an examination of fairness in the context of combinations of protected attributes and the output. A new definition of fairness is proposed, which takes into account the representation of all combinations of $k$ protected attributes and the output, aiming for equitable representation across these combinations.

A fair dataset is defined as one in which, for each combination of protected attributes $\{A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_k\}$ and the output $O_j$, the representation is equal and proportional. Mathematically, a dataset is fair if:

\[
\forall i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k, j: \frac{|D_{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k, j}|}{|D|} = \text{constant}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}

    \item $D$ is the dataset

    \item $|D_{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k, j}|$ is the number of samples with the specific combination of protected attributes $A_{i_1}, A_{i_2}, \ldots, A_{i_k}$ and output $O_j$

    \item $|D|$ is the total number of samples in the dataset
    
\end{itemize}

This entails that any combination of demographic groups, defined by the protected attributes, and the output should have comparable representation, thereby fostering a balanced and unbiased dataset.

By striving for equal representation of combinations of protected attributes, is addressed a fundamental aspect of fairness that transcends individual attributes. This approach provides a more nuanced understanding of fairness by considering the intersections of various demographic groups. It encourages a broader examination of potential biases that may arise when considering multiple attributes simultaneously.

Incorporating this definition of fairness into the data augmentation process enables us to promote a comprehensive notion of fairness, aligning with the principles of equal opportunity and non-discrimination across all combinations of protected attributes. The subsequent algorithm and experimental evaluation are designed to actualize this definition and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving a more equitable representation within the dataset.

Let $D$ be a dataset $R^{n \times m}$, where $n$ is the number of samples and $m$ is the number of features. Let $k$ be the number of protected variables represented as $R^{n \times 1}$, with $u_i$ the number of unique values for the $i$-th protected variable. Let there be a single output variable represented as $R^{n \times 1}$.

A data augmentation function $\mathcal{R}$ can be formally defined as a mapping:
\[
\mathcal{R}: R^{n \times m} \rightarrow R^{a \times m}
\]
where $a > n$, and the function $\mathcal{R}$ transforms the input dataset $D$ of dimensions $n \times m$ into an output dataset $D'$ of dimensions $a \times m$.

The number of possible combinations of these variables is $\prod_{i=1}^{k+1} u_i$. The limit of the product is ${k + 1}$ because for the combination are considered the protected attributes together with the output.

Consider a set $\text{Combinations}$ with occurrences of all $\prod_{i=1}^{k+1} u_i$ combinations within the dataset. 

Consider a set $\text{Frequencies}$ with frequency of all combination in $\text{Combinations}$ set.

For each combination, the number of rows in which that combination appears should be equal to the maximum of $\text{Frequencies}$ set, denoted as $\text{Max(Frequencies)}$

Mathematically, the number of rows ($a - n$) that will be added to the dataset by the data augmentation algorithm is given by:
\[
a - n = \sum_{i=1}^{|Combinations|}(\text{Max}(\text{Frequency}) - (\text{Frequency\textunderscore i}))
\]

Once having detected the number of rows to add for each combination it's important to define how to are detected the element of each row.

Let $C$ be the sub-dataset of $D$ with a specific combination $\text{c\textunderscore i}$ for the protected attributes. Given the number of rows \text{Max}(\text{Frequency}) - (\text{Frequency\textunderscore i}) each row is added according to the following rules:

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item The values of the protected and output variables are set according to the specific combination.
   
    \item For all other attributes, a random value $\text{random\_value}_{ij}$ is generated, where $j$ represents the specific attribute, and $i$ represents the row being added for that attribute. $\text{random\_value}_{ij}$ is within the minimum and maximum range for attribute $j$.

\end{itemize}

Before proceeding in the theoretical analysis of the algorithm here's the proposed pseudocode:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
    \caption{Reabalancing}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \State \textbf{Input:} combination\_set, combination\_frequency, protected\_attributes, dataset\_attributes
        \State \textbf{Output:} Updated dataset

        \State max\_frequency $\gets$ max(combination\_frequency)

        \For{index \textbf{in} (0, len(combination\_set) - 1)}
            \State combination $\gets$ combination\_set[index]
            \State frequency $\gets$ combination\_frequency[index]
            \State combination\_dataset $\gets$ dataset[dataset[combination] == combination\_set[index]]

            \While{frequency $<$ max\_frequency}
                \State new\_row $\gets$ empty

                \For{(attr, val) \textbf{in} (combination, protected\_attributes)}
                    \State new\_row[attr] $\gets$ val
                \EndFor

                \For{attr \textbf{in} dataset\_attributes \textbf{and not in} protected\_attributes}
                    \State new\_row[attr] $\gets$ random(min(combination\_dataset[attr]), max(combination\_dataset[attr]))
                \EndFor

                \State dataset.add(new\_row)
                \State frequency $+$= 1
            \EndWhile
        \EndFor

        \State \textbf{return} Updated dataset
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The proposed data augmentation algorithm aims to achieve fairness by ensuring an equal representation of all possible combinations of protected and output variables. Here, we provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithm's key aspects, including time complexity, space complexity, and additional considerations.

The time complexity is influenced by the dataset size ($n$), the number of features ($m$), and the number of combinations of protected attributes and output. The overall time complexity is given by the number of combinations:
\[
\mathcal{O}(n \cdot m \cdot |Combinations|)
\]
where $|Combinations|$ is the number of combinations that have been computed

The space complexity is determined by the storage of combination frequencies and the occurrence count array. The overall space complexity is given by:
\[
\mathcal{O}(\prod_{i=1}^{k+1} u_i)
\]

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Number of Combinations:} The number of combinations \(\prod_{i=1}^{k+1} u_i\) grows exponentially with the number of protected binary variables (\(k\)), significantly influencing both time and space complexity.
    
    \item \textbf{Data Augmentation Techniques:} The algorithm's effectiveness depends on the chosen data augmentation techniques, which may introduce additional computational costs.
    
    \item \textbf{Random Value Generation:} The quality of randomness in generated values is crucial for the diversity of the augmented dataset and, consequently, the algorithm's fairness outcomes.
    
    \item \textbf{Implementation and Optimization:} The efficiency of the algorithm is affected by implementation details, language choice, and potential optimizations.
\end{itemize}
