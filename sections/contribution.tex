\subsection{Importance of Stakeholder Integration}

\subsubsection{Cultural Sensitivity}

Stakeholders, representing diverse backgrounds, contribute significantly to a nuanced understanding of cultural norms and sensitivities within the fair-by-design approach. This diversity is crucial in recognizing attributes that may be culturally significant and warrant protection. For instance, certain cultural or religious practices may involve sensitive information that should be identified as a protected attribute to ensure respectful and unbiased treatment.

By actively involving stakeholders who bring a range of cultural perspectives, the objective-setting process can identify and address potential biases associated with cultural attributes, fostering a system that respects and reflects the rich diversity of its user base. This approach not only enhances fairness but also promotes cultural sensitivity and inclusivity in the design and implementation of the system.

Through the fair-by-design methodology, cultural considerations become integral to the ethical framework, ensuring that the system acknowledges and respects the cultural context of its users. This not only aligns the technology with ethical standards but also contributes to a more inclusive and culturally aware development process, ultimately leading to a system that is more equitable and considerate of the diverse cultural backgrounds of its users.

\subsubsection{Contextual Relevance}

Stakeholders play a crucial role in providing contextual insights that may not be evident in the dataset alone within the fair-by-design approach. Their considerations can guide the identification of attributes relevant to the specific application and its ethical implications. For instance, in an educational context, stakeholders might highlight attributes related to socio-economic status or learning styles that could impact fairness considerations in student evaluations.

By actively involving stakeholders, the objective-setting process gains valuable perspectives that enrich the ethical framework of the system. This collaborative approach ensures that the identified objectives not only align with technical requirements but also address real-world considerations, promoting a more holistic and socially responsible system.

\section{Data Pre-processing}
\label{section:pre-proc}

Following the completion of data collection and the incorporation of stakeholder considerations, the subsequent pivotal stage in the workflow is data pre-processing. This critical phase is dedicated to meticulously preparing and cleansing the dataset with the overarching goal of addressing biases, rectifying imbalances, and ensuring a fair and equitable foundation for the ensuing stages of the fair-by-design workflow. The emphasis during data pre-processing is on refining the dataset to foster a more equitable and unbiased representation, thus laying the groundwork for robust and ethical data-driven decision-making processes.

\subsection{Key Considerations}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item \emph{Data cleaning:} 

    This process involves identifying and rectifying errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in the raw dataset to ensure its reliability and quality. Common tasks in data cleaning include handling missing values, correcting data format issues, removing duplicates, and addressing outliers. The goal is to create a clean, standardized dataset that forms a solid foundation for subsequent analysis and model development. Rigorous data cleaning is essential for mitigating the risk of biased or inaccurate model outcomes, as machine learning models heavily depend on the quality of the input data. This meticulous attention to data quality sets the stage for effective feature engineering, model training, and, ultimately, the generation of reliable and fair predictions.

    \item \emph{Handling Protected Attributes:} 
    
    Within the Fair-by-Design workflow, categorical protected attributes undergo a transformation process to ensure fairness in subsequent machine learning stages. This process involves setting a threshold for each protected attribute and replacing values above the threshold with 1, and values below the threshold with 0.

    Let \(P\) be the set of protected attributes, and \(p_i\) represent a specific protected attribute within \(P\). The threshold, denoted as \(t_i\), is determined for each categorical protected attribute \(p_i\) in the dataset through the following formalism:

    \[
    t_i = \frac{\text{min}(p_i) + \text{max}(p_i)}{2}
    \]

    This calculation ensures a nuanced understanding of the prevalent categories within these attributes and establishes a threshold \(t_i\) for distinguishing between them.

    The binary representation preserves essential information about protected attributes, providing a condensed yet informative encoding that reflects the privilege or lack thereof concerning specific attributes.

    During the training phase, the model learns to distinguish instances based on privilege or lack thereof concerning specific attributes, as represented by the binary encoding. This is achieved by replacing values according to the following transformation:

    \[
    \text{Binary Encoding}(p_i) = \begin{cases} 

        1 & \text{if } p_i > t_i \\

        0 & \text{if } p_i \leq t_i 

    \end{cases}
    \]

    This facilitates effective model incorporation and decision-making during training and prediction phases.

    The nuanced encoding strategy, where values over the threshold are replaced with 1 and values under the threshold are replaced with 0, serves as the foundation for unbiased and fair treatment of instances within the model. By transforming categorical protected attributes based on the specified threshold definition, the Fair-by-Design workflow ensures that subsequent machine learning models can effectively incorporate and act upon this information during training and prediction phases, contributing significantly to the development of a more equitable and ethically sound machine learning model.

    \item \emph{Handling Output Variable:} 
    
    The handling of the output variable in the Fair-by-Design workflow is a nuanced process that adapts to the nature of the variable, whether categorical or continuous. This tailored treatment is essential for aligning the prediction task with the fairness objectives of the workflow, ensuring that the model's predictions are not only accurate but also ethically sound.


    In cases where the output variable is categorical, the workflow initiates by determining the most frequent value within this category. Let $Y$ represent the output variable, and $y_i$ be a specific outcome within $Y$. The most frequent value, denoted as $y_{\text{freq}}$, is determined through the following formalism:

    \[
    y_{\text{freq}} = \text{argmax}_y \left( \text{count}(Y = y) \right)
    \]

    This strategic calculation provides insights into the prevailing outcome within the dataset. Subsequently, instances where the output variable matches $y_{\text{freq}}$ are replaced with the binary representation 1, while all other instances take on the binary representation 0. The binary encoding function is defined as follows:

    \[
    \text{Binary Encoding}(y_i) = \begin{cases} 
    1 & \text{if } y_i = y_{\text{freq}} \\ 
    0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]

    This transformation effectively redefines the prediction task, shifting the focus to discerning whether a given sample belongs to the most frequent outcome. The binary encoding approach not only simplifies the representation of categorical outcomes but also enables the model to make predictions in a manner that aligns with fairness considerations.


    Conversely, when the output variable is continuous, the workflow employs a distinct strategy. Let $Z$ represent the continuous output variable, and $z_i$ be a specific value within $Z$. Values of the continuous variable that surpass the mean are replaced with 1, while those falling below the mean assume the binary representation 0. This adjustment transforms the prediction task into establishing whether a sample's continuous output is above the mean. The binary encoding function for continuous variables is defined as:

    \[
    \text{Binary Encoding}(z_i) = \begin{cases} 
    1 & \text{if } z_i > \text{mean}(Z) \\ 
    0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]

    This approach ensures that the model is not only attentive to the central tendency of the continuous variable but also considers the distribution of values concerning the mean.

    This tailored and meticulous treatment of the output variable underscores the commitment of the Fair-by-Design workflow to equitable and ethical machine learning practices. The workflow not only adapts to the inherent characteristics of the data but also ensures that the subsequent model operates with a heightened awareness of fairness considerations, contributing to the development of a more responsible and unbiased machine learning model.

\end{enumerate}

This nuanced pre-processing step sets the groundwork for a fair and unbiased learning prediction, aligning the dataset with the ethical considerations embedded in the Fair-by-Design workflow.

\section{Algorithm Design}
\label{section: algorithm-design}

The stage of Algorithm Design within the fair-by-design workflow stands as a pivotal phase wherein the selection, adaptation, or creation of machine learning models takes place to harmonize with the specified objectives and fairness considerations. The primary objective is to craft models that not only excel in accuracy but also steadfastly adhere to ethical and fair principles. This section undertakes an in-depth exploration of the crucial considerations, strategic approaches, and the step-by-step implementation processes entailed in Algorithm Design. By navigating through these aspects, the aim is to foster the development of models that not only deliver superior performance but also champion the ideals of ethics and fairness in their predictive outcomes.

These models are systematically explored and evaluated for their capacity to mitigate biases and foster fairness, thereby contributing to the overarching goal of cultivating just and impartial predictive systems.
    
    \item \emph{Regularization Techniques:} 
    
    In the pursuit of fair predictions, regularization methods, exemplified by demographic parity constraints or equalized odds constraints, emerge as instrumental tools. These methodologies are strategically employed to guide machine learning models towards fairness objectives. By integrating fairness constraints into the optimization process, these regularization techniques play a pivotal role in steering the model to yield equitable outcomes across various demographic groups. The inclusion of such constraints serves as a proactive measure to counteract biases and ensure that the predictive power of the model remains impartial and just across diverse demographic contexts.

    \item \emph{Bias Detection and Mitigation:} 
    
    The integration of embedding mechanisms within the algorithm to detect and mitigate biases is of paramount importance. This entails the ongoing and systematic monitoring of the model's predictions for any indications of disparate impact. Subsequently, corrective measures are implemented in real-time to mitigate biases as they manifest. This proactive approach to bias detection and mitigation serves as a fundamental component in ensuring the model's fairness and equity. By embedding mechanisms that facilitate continuous scrutiny and timely interventions, the algorithm is fortified to deliver more impartial and just predictions, aligning with the principles of ethical and fair machine learning.

    \item \emph{Pre-processing, In-processing, or Post-processing Algorithms:} 
    
    The strategic decision regarding the selection of pre-processing, in-processing, or post-processing algorithms is intricately tied to the specific characteristics of the data and the defined fairness goals. Pre-processing algorithms, characterized by their ability to transform the dataset prior to model training, set the initial conditions for fairness considerations. In-processing algorithms, on the other hand, directly modify the learning process during model training, introducing fairness mechanisms at this crucial stage. Post-processing algorithms, as the name implies, come into play after model training, adjusting predictions to align with fairness objectives.

    When making this strategic decision, it is imperative to consider the nature of biases inherent in the data, the characteristics of the available dataset, and the desired level of fairness. Each approach—pre-processing, in-processing, or post-processing—offers distinct advantages and considerations, and the choice among them should be informed by a comprehensive understanding of the specific fairness challenges and objectives inherent to the machine learning task at hand.

\subsection{Pre-processing Algorithm Proposed}

\subsubsection{Fairness through data rebalancing}
\label{subsec:ftdr}

In this approach, the paradigm of bias mitigation takes on a unique and innovative perspective, one that prioritizes data augmentation over attribute removal. Unlike traditional approaches that center on the exclusion of specific attributes, this methodology embraces the concept of data augmentation, introducing a distinctive definition of fairness and equity within the AI system.

The essence of this approach revolves around the augmentation of the dataset by introducing new data instances that offer a more comprehensive and inclusive representation of the underlying population. This expanded dataset is designed to be more diverse, representative, and balanced, transcending the limitations of the original data and fostering a more nuanced understanding of fairness. 

The introduction of augmented data instances leads to a redefined notion of fairness within the AI system. Instead of solely focusing on the absence of biased attributes, fairness is now measured in terms of the dataset's inclusivity and its ability to capture the diversity and nuances present within the population it seeks to serve. 

This approach aligns with the broader philosophy of ensuring that AI systems are equitable, just, and capable of making informed and unbiased decisions. By augmenting the dataset, it strives to bridge the gaps in representation and provide a more equitable playing field for all individuals, regardless of their background or characteristics. 

The process of data augmentation necessitates a careful selection of techniques and methodologies that can introduce new data instances while maintaining the integrity and quality of the dataset. These techniques may encompass oversampling, synthetic data generation, or other data synthesis methods, each tailored to the specific context and objectives of the AI system.

In traditional fairness definitions, the focus often revolves around ensuring fair treatment for individual protected attributes, denoted as $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_k$. While this is undoubtedly crucial, a more comprehensive understanding of fairness calls for an examination of fairness in the context of combinations of protected attributes and the output. A new definition of fairness is proposed, which takes into account the representation of all combinations of $k$ protected attributes and the output, aiming for equitable representation across these combinations.

A fair dataset is defined as one in which, for each combination of protected attributes $\{A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_k\}$ and the output $O_j$, the representation is equal and proportional. Mathematically, a dataset is fair if:

\[
\forall i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k, j: \frac{|D_{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k, j}|}{|D|} = \text{constant}
\]

where:
- $D$ is the dataset,
- $|D_{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k, j}|$ is the number of samples with the specific combination of protected attributes $A_{i_1}, A_{i_2}, \ldots, A_{i_k}$ and output $O_j$,
- $|D|$ is the total number of samples in the dataset.

This entails that any combination of demographic groups, defined by the protected attributes, and the output should have comparable representation, thereby fostering a balanced and unbiased dataset.

By striving for equal representation of combinations of protected attributes, is addressed a fundamental aspect of fairness that transcends individual attributes. This approach provides a more nuanced understanding of fairness by considering the intersections of various demographic groups. It encourages a broader examination of potential biases that may arise when considering multiple attributes simultaneously.

Incorporating this definition of fairness into the dataset rebalancing process enables us to promote a comprehensive notion of fairness, aligning with the principles of equal opportunity and non-discrimination across all combinations of protected attributes. The subsequent algorithm and experimental evaluation are designed to actualize this definition and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving a more equitable representation within the dataset.

At this point it's necessary to begin with a formalization for the algorithm itself.


Let \( D \) be a dataset \( R^{n \times m} \), where \( n \) is the number of samples and \( m \) is the number of features. Let \( k \) be the number of protected variables represented as \( R^{n \times 1} \), and let there be a single output variable represented as \( R^{n \times 1} \).

A rebalancing function \( \mathcal{R} \) can be formally defined as a mapping:

\[
\mathcal{R}: R^{n \times m} \rightarrow R^{l \times m}
\]

where \( l > m \), and the function \( \mathcal{R} \) transforms the input dataset \( D \) of dimensions \( n \times m \) into an output dataset \( D' \) of dimensions \( l \times m \).



Let \( k \) be the number of binary protected variables in the dataset \( D \), and consider the output variable to be binary as well. The number of possible combinations of these variables is \( 2^{(k+1)} \).

Consider a set \( \text{Combination-frequency} \) with occurrences of all \( 2^{(k+1)} \) combinations within the dataset. For each combination, the number of rows in which that combination appears should be equal to the maximum occurrence among all combinations present in the set \( \text{Combination\textunderscore frequency} \). This maximum value is denoted as \( \text{Max}(\text{Combination-frequency}) \).

Mathematically, the number of rows (\( l \)) the final dataset should have for each combination is given by:

\[
l = \text{Max}(\text{Combination-frequency})
\]



Let \( l \) be the desired number of rows for the final dataset. For each combination of values, is calculated the occurrence count \( \text{occurrence}_i \), where \( i \) ranges from 1 to \( 2^{(k+1)} \), with \( k \) being the number of protected binary variables and considering the output variable as binary.

The total number of rows to be added is given by:

\[
\text{total\_rows\_to\_add} = l - \sum_{i=1}^{2^{(k+1)}} \text{occurrence}_i
\]

For each iteration:

\begin{itemize}

    \item The values of the protected and output variables are set according to the specific combination.
