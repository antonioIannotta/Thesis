\label{section:model-training}

\subsection{Introduction}

This section delivers a thorough overview of the model training and evaluation process within the Fair-by-Design framework. After the careful application of the chosen pre-processing, in-processing, or post-processing algorithm, the training phase assumes a pivotal role in shaping a machine learning model. The emphasis extends beyond mere accuracy objectives to incorporate the ethical considerations of fairness. This holistic approach underscores the commitment to developing models that excel not only in predictive performance but also adhere to principles of equity and justice, thereby embodying the ethos of the Fair-by-Design framework.

\subsection{Training Process}

\subsubsection{Data Splitting}

The dataset undergoes a deliberate split into training, validation, and test sets, each serving a distinct strategic purpose. The training set acts as the foundation for the model's learning process, enabling it to grasp patterns and relationships within the data. The validation set plays a crucial role in hyperparameter tuning, fine-tuning the model to enhance its generalization capabilities. Finally, the test set serves as the litmus test for the final model's performance, offering a reliable measure of its predictive capabilities. This meticulous division ensures a comprehensive and robust evaluation of the model's effectiveness and generalizability within the Fair-by-Design framework.

\subsubsection{Model Architecture}

The architecture of the selected model is meticulously crafted to strike a delicate balance between accuracy and fairness considerations within the Fair-by-Design framework. Architectures may incorporate innovative components, such as adversarial layers or customized modules specifically designed to enforce fairness constraints. The focal point is to develop a model that excels not only in capturing intricate patterns but is also interpretable and transparent in its decision-making process. This intentional design reflects the commitment to fostering models that go beyond predictive prowess, embodying principles of interpretability and transparency while addressing fairness concerns.

\subsubsection{Training Parameters}

Critical training parameters, spanning the learning rate, batch size, and convergence criteria, undergo meticulous tuning in the Fair-by-Design framework. The learning rate assumes significance as it dictates the step size in the optimization process, thereby influencing the pace of updates to model parameters. This parameter is pivotal in determining the balance between the model's adaptability and stability during training.

The batch size, another key parameter, determines the number of samples processed in each iteration. This factor significantly impacts the overall efficiency of the training process, influencing resource utilization and the model's ability to generalize well to diverse datasets.

Convergence criteria hold a crucial role by ensuring that the training process halts when the model achieves optimal performance. These criteria are indispensable in preventing overfitting, safeguarding against the model becoming excessively tailored to the training data to the detriment of its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

This comprehensive tuning process, applicable beyond deep models, reflects a nuanced approach in optimizing key parameters to foster models that not only exhibit accuracy but also align with fairness considerations in the Fair-by-Design paradigm.

\subsubsection{Fairness Constraints}

In scenarios where fairness constraints are seamlessly integrated into the training process within the Fair-by-Design framework, a deliberate and systematic approach is adopted. These constraints are explicitly defined and enforced, often involving the introduction of regularization terms designed to penalize disparate treatment of different demographic groups. This strategic incorporation aims to instill fairness by discouraging the model from exhibiting biased behavior towards specific groups.

Adversarial training components might also be leveraged in this process. These components act as a countermeasure to mitigate bias, introducing a dynamic element that works to identify and neutralize any discriminatory patterns that may emerge during training. The overall objective is to foster models that not only deliver accurate predictions but also adhere to ethical principles of fairness and equity. This intentional integration of fairness constraints reinforces the commitment to cultivating machine learning models that contribute to just and unbiased outcomes.

\subsubsection{Model Training}

The model undergoes training for a specified number of iterations, leveraging the training set to iteratively update its parameters and increase accuracy. This iterative training process is not limited to deep learning models and is applicable across various model categories. The overarching goal remains to strike a balance between accuracy and fairness, contributing to the development of a machine learning model proficient in capturing underlying patterns while being conscious of potential biases.

Through successive iterations on the training set, the model refines its understanding of the data, aiming to optimize its performance with due consideration to fairness. This approach aligns with the principles of the Fair-by-Design framework, ensuring that the trained model is both technically robust and ethically sound in its decision-making, irrespective of the specific model category employed.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

\subsubsection{Accuracy Metrics}

A suite of accuracy metrics is employed to holistically assess the model's overall performance:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Accuracy:} The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
    
    \item \emph{Precision:} The proportion of true positive predictions among instances predicted as positive.
    
    \item \emph{Recall:} The proportion of true positive predictions among actual positive instances.
    
    \item \emph{F1-score:} The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of accuracy.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Fairness Metrics}

Fairness metrics are instrumental in evaluating the model's behavior across different demographic groups:

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item \emph{Equalized Odds Evaluation Metric}: The Equalized Odds metric serves as a critical assessment tool for gauging the model's performance concerning fairness. This evaluation metric specifically investigates whether the model exhibits comparable false positive and false negative rates across distinct demographic groups. By scrutinizing disparities in these rates, the Equalized Odds metric offers insights into the model's capacity to provide equitable outcomes for diverse segments of the population, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of its fairness considerations, as reported in \cref{section:metrics}
    
    \item \emph{Statistical Parity:} The Statistical Parity metric is a meticulous examination of the distribution of positive outcomes within each demographic group. This evaluation metric meticulously analyzes the proportion of positive results for each group, aiming to identify and quantify any disparities that may exist. By shedding light on these disparities, the Statistical Parity metric offers a nuanced perspective on how the model's predictions align with different demographic segments. This in-depth analysis contributes to a comprehensive assessment of fairness, facilitating a more detailed understanding of potential imbalances in positive outcomes across diverse groups, as reported in \cref{section:metrics}
